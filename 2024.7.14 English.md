# how to learn English well ?

today i have learn some methods about how to learn English well, here's the things 

teacher tiffany gives three of methods,but i only remember first two of them.

- First thing is make three friends learning english together,and when you learned some new words, you can share to them,to the first one, you may get nervous,and the second you get more familiar, and the final one you can speak your idea fluently, it's quite a way to remember knowledge fast.
- Second thing is that you should write it down about what you have learned and explain it.Basically, write something down is build the neuron in your brain. And the two methods can mutually promote to each other.

Vocabularies i learned,

- first is gucci, it means good or nice.
- second is cross between A and B, it mean kind of mixing A and B. As a example, The new breed of dog is kind of cross between Labrador and Poodle.
